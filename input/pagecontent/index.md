### About FHIR Shorthand

The FSH IG includes the following information:

1. This page, providing introductory material  _(informative content)_.
1. [FHIR Shorthand Overview](overview.html) -- Introduction to FSH language and SUSHI (a reference implementation and _de facto_ standard FSH compiler) _(informative content)_.
1. [FHIR Shorthand Language Reference](reference.html) -- The syntax and usage of the FHIR Shorthand language _(formal content)_.
1. [Quick Reference Card](FSHQuickReference.pdf) -- A cheat sheet for FSH syntax and examples _(informative content)_.
1. [FSH Grammar](https://github.com/FHIR/sushi/tree/v3.8.0/antlr/src/main/antlr) -- An [ANTLR v4](https://www.antlr.org/) representation of the FSH syntax _(informative content)_.
1. [Change Log](change_log.html) -- A history of changes to the FHIR Shorthand specification _(informative content)_.
1. [Full Implementation Guide Zip File](full-ig.zip) -- A downloadable zip file containing the HTML and supporting files for this full specification.


The following materials, useful for learning and applying FHIR Shorthand but not part of the language specification, are found on [FSHSchool.org](https://fshschool.org/):

1. [SUSHI User Guide](https://fshschool.org/docs/sushi/) -- SUSHI ("SUSHI Unshortens ShortHand Inputs") is a reference implementation and _de facto_ standard interpreter/compiler for FHIR Shorthand. SUSHI produces [Health Level Seven (HL7®) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®)](https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/overview.html) profiles, extensions, and other artifacts needed to create FHIR Implementation Guides (IG).
1. [GoFSH User Guide](https://fshschool.org/docs/gofsh/) -- GoFSH is a tool that turns FHIR artifacts into FSH. Using GoFSH, existing FHIR artifacts or complete Implementation Guides can be transformed into FSH, automatically.
1. [FSH Visual Studio Code Extension Overview](https://fshschool.org/docs/vscode/) -- The FSH Visual Studio Code extension provides syntax highlighting, code snippets, path completion, and other features that improve FSH authoring efficiency. 
1. [FHIR Shorthand Tutorials](https://fshschool.org/docs/tutorials/) -- A step-by-step hands-on introduction to producing an Implementation Guide (IG) with FHIR Shorthand and SUSHI.
1. [FHIR Shorthand Seminar](https://fshschool.org/courses/) -- A comprehensive overview of FHIR IG authoring basics for people who are interested in being able to independently create FHIR IGs.
1. [FSH Online](https://fshschool.org/FSHOnline/#/) -- A coding playground for FSH, an online environment that allows you to write FSH and convert it to FHIR artifacts, convert FHIR artifacts to FSH, access examples, and share FSH code with others.
1. [FSH Finder](https://fshschool.org/fsh-finder/) -- A list of public GitHub repositories that contain FSH code, refreshed daily.

Note that the [Language Reference](reference.html) is the formal specification, and if there is any conflict between that and any other written or programmatic materials, the former is considered the source of truth.

#### Version Number

FHIR Shorthand follows the same modified [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) approach as FHIR. See the documentation on versioning in [FHIR Releases and Versioning](https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/versions.html#versions) for more detail. Implementers are encouraged to clearly indicate what version or versions of the FSH specification they implement.

### Issue Reporting and Contributions

* FSH language issues and suggestions can be made [in the HL7 Jira](https://jira.hl7.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20FHIR%20AND%20Specification%20%3D%20%22Shorthand%20(FHIR)%20%5BFHIR-shorthand%5D%22). When filing FSH language or IG issues, use project="FHIR" AND Specification = "Shorthand (FHIR) [FHIR-shorthand]".

* SUSHI bugs, issues, and suggestions can be made [here](https://github.com/FHIR/sushi/issues).

* GoFSH bugs, issues, and suggestions can be made [here](https://github.com/FHIR/GoFSH).

* If your FSH project is not listed in FSH Finder, log an issue [here](https://github.com/FSHSchool/fsh-finder/issues) or submit a pull request on the list of organizations in [settings.yml](https://github.com/FSHSchool/fsh-finder/tree/v1.1).

* FSH examples for inclusion in FSH Online can be contributed [here](https://github.com/FSHSchool/FSHOnline-Examples).
